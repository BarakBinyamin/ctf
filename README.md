### Requirements
#### Hardware
- [3 ESP32 dev boards](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=3+esp32+wrover), typically boards with an esp32 that has a cap with more detailed descriptions are higher quality,  3 for $15 is a good deal as of 2023
- [Micro usb cable](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=microusb)
- [Breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=breadboards)
- [Led's](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=leds+100+pieces+color)
- [Resistors](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=resistor+kit)

#### Software
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [PlatformIO vscode extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [This Repo](https://github.com/BarakBinyamin/ctf)
```
git clone https://github.com/BarakBinyamin/ctf.git && cd ctf
```

### Setup - Create an IOT Light
Use [this diagram]() as a reference to wire up your IOT-Light
1. Open [iot-light/app](iot-light/app) a terminal 
2. From the cmd line run `node index.js` to launch the app server, the app should be available at [http://localhost](http://localhost), `http://<your ip address>`, and `http://<your hostname>`, scan the QR code to jump to the app on your phone if your on the same wifi as your laptop
3. Run the `hostname` command in a bash terminal to find the hostname of your computer
4. Open [iot-light/light](iot-light/light) in its own vscode window
5. Plug in an esp32 dev board
6. Add your wifi credentials and hostname to [iot-light/include/config.h](iot-light/include/config.h) 
```
#define SSID     "SSID"                           
#define PASS     "PASS"                        
#define WSSERVER "IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOSTNAME_OF_SERVER"   
#define WSPORT   80     
```
7. PlatformIO <img src="https://github.com/BarakBinyamin/RIT-CE-toolbox/assets/60147768/15385a35-3bf9-4561-a204-b651d776f4a1" width="15" height="15">->blue1->upload&monitor

### Attack
Getting full control of the IOT light
#### Overview
1. Use tools like [Fing](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/fing-network-scanner/id430921107) and [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) to find the IOT-light connected to the wifi
2. Setup a malicous router with same wifi and ssid as the target, launch & connect [malicous servers](attack/servers) to it
3. Use the Maurauder to disconnect the **IOT-Light** so it will recconnect to the fake access point
4. Identify web requests from the IOT-light using network tools like `tcpdump` and wireshark
5. When a request to get the new firmware is made, the IOT-light will get the firmware provided by the malicous servers

#### Attack Prep Part 1/2 - Create an ESP32Marauder
1. Open the [ESP32Marauder](ESP32Marauder) folder in vscode, let platformio process
2. From the platformio menu, select upload
3. Connect to the **MarauderOTA** wifi, password is **justcallmekoko**
4. Go to [192.18.4.1](http://192.18.4.1)
5. Login with user **admin** password **admin**
6. Choose file -> [.../ESP32Marauder/esp32_marauder_v0_13_3_20231114_old_hardware.bin](ESP32Marauder/esp32_marauder_v0_13_3_20231114_old_hardware.bin), and select update
7. Wait like 60 seconds, a little after the 100% percent feedback is reached
8. Great! You made a marauder! Now you can connect over serial using the platformio monitor button, after a few confguartion messages the cli should pop up
```

         ESP32 Marauder

            v0.13.4

``` 
#### Attack Prep Part 2/2 - Create a mini wifi router
1. Open the esp32_nat_server folder in vscode, let platformio process, then press the upload button 
2. On another device you should see a wifi named **ESP32 NAT router**, connect
3. A router settings page should be available @ [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1)

For reference, the following line in [esp32_nat_router/main/esp32_nat_router.c](esp32_nat_router/main/esp32_nat_router.c) has been changed so that the first device connnected is the default dns server if traffic is not being forwarded to another router
```c++
#define DEFAULT_DNS "192.168.4.2"
```

#### Launching an attack

##### Finding the target, analysing newtork requests
Options  
- Use [Fing](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/fing-network-scanner/id430921107) to identify devices on the same network
- Use the maurader to discconect the target from the wifi, host a router that will route dns requests to your computer, use a dns server to analze requests made from the target. 
- On a malicous router running linux, it is possible to view network traffic using `tcpdump`

##### Use Maurauder to disconnect the **IOT-Light** 
1. `scanap` with the marauder to save a list of access points
2. `stopscan` after you've seen the ssid the **IOT-light** is connected to
3. `scansta` with the marauder to save a list of stations and their access points
4. `stopscan` after about 30 seconds
4. `list -c` to find the router with ssid and maximum connection (That's our real router) 
5. `select -a <ap-number>` to select the device to fake death packets from so devices will switch to the fake access point
6. `attack -t deauth`, but `attack -t probe` may also work

#### Patch for the attack
Have the iot device check the authorship of the tls certificate

#TODO what is tls and how is authorship confirmed

## Motivation
IOT devices are commonly built with certain hardware constraints, limiting them to use IP over wifi or some subset of wireless communication protocol like Zigbee or espnow to interact with each other

Wireless communication represents a hardware security risk, being that another Wi-Fi capable device in close proximity could intercept data without being detected, as well mascaraed as the intended recipient and send back malicious data

[Hardware security threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)) are all across the board, including 
- **Spoofing** ex. Malicious router broadcasting the same name/ssid as a trusted router
- **Tampering** ex. Man in the middle altering data
- **Information disclosure** ex. Man in the middle capturing data
- **Repudiation** ex. Malicious router can imitate authorship credentials
- **Denial of Service** ex. Deauth with udp packets or flooding wifi channel with noise
- **Elevation of Privilege** ex. Canâ€™t think of one at the moment but there is probably one out there
